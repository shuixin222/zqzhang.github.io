# Crosswalk Project for Linux

The Crosswalk Project for Linux enables the creation of Linux desktop applications using web technologies. It is based on the Chromium content layer and its integration with the Linux desktop UI.

As with other platforms, the Crosswalk Project for Linux supports advanced Web APIs like WebGL, WebRTC, WebAudio, ServiceWorker, SIMD and Web Manifest.

This distribution includes a .deb package of the Crosswalk runtime and a backend for the crosswalk-app-tools command line suite to package Crosswalk applications for Debian Linux. The Crosswalk package is tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and Deepin Linux 2014.2
