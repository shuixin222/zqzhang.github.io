## Make Good Use of GitHub Issues

Crosswalk QA Team once decided to use [Crosswalk JIRA -> Test Suite](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK/component/10303) to track the tasks of creating test cases to cover the test gaps from the community feedback. This will sharply increase the number of JIRA tickets which makes the crosswalk test suite component of the JIRA system ugly and impenetrable. Thus the team has to seek for other means to track the TODO lists.

Someone suggests leverage existing JIRA instance internally, but Zhiqiang strongly disagrees to use any kind of internals for the open sourced project. One of the shortcomings is that internal tracking system will make the task tracking and contribution from outside hard and dilemma.

Someone advices to send emails about the tasks to the component owner and related persons; but it is impossible to track the tasks status, not to say effectively handle the tasks.

Finally, the team find out the [crosswalk-test-suite issues](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-test-suite/issues) and file some tasks as below.
