title: Web Weekly 12
---

**Note**: renamed the Crosswalk Weekly news letter to Web Weekly from this time
because my job scope has been extended in all web platform technologies for
these projects:

* [Crosswalk Project](https://crosswalk-project.org)
* [Ostro Project](https://ostroproject.org/)
* [Soletta Project](https://solettaproject.org/)
* [W3C web platform tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests)
* [W3C csswg test](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-test)

Thus the weekly news letter will cover all of them related.

## Crosswalk Project Extensions for RealSense is avaiable

Intel® RealSense™ technology redefines how we interact with our devices for
a more natural, intuitive and immersive experience. By introducing 3D cameras
with depth information combined with regular RGB data, new use cases are
possible such as augmented reality, hand/face recognition, object tracking,
and more. The Crosswalk Project Extensions for RealSense now brings these
amazing capabilities to web developers.

Our first public release (part of [Crosswalk
v18.6.0](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/realsense-extensions-crosswalk/releases/tag/v18.6.0))
includes the following:

* [Depth Enhanced Photography](https://crosswalk-project.github.io/realsense-extensions-crosswalk/spec/depth-enabled-photography.html)
* [Scene Perception](https://crosswalk-project.github.io/realsense-extensions-crosswalk/spec/scene-perception.html)
* [Face Tracking and Recognition](https://crosswalk-project.github.io/realsense-extensions-crosswalk/spec/face.html)

Developers can create 3D-aware web applications that can be run on any Windows
tablet with a built-in [R200
camera](https://software.intel.com/en-us/RealSense/R200Camera), such as the
[HP Spectre
x2](http://store.hp.com/us/en/ContentView?storeId=10151&langId=-1&catalogId=10051&eSpotName=new-detachable),
or a Windows PC with peripheral R200 camera.

## Ostro Project is open

The Ostro Project is an open source developed, Linux*-based operating system
tailored for IoT smart devices, and built with security in mind. Never again
will you need to force-fit a general Linux OS to suit your IoT device, or write
your own OS. The Ostro OS is simple for existing Linux users to adopt and it
conveniently provides an application framework which supports multiple developer
languages. It is out-of-the-box ready to be installed and has powerful features
which easily support IoT device development.
 
Ostro Project provides simplified access to complicated IoT required constructs
including pre-configured and validated sensor support; various level of security
mechanisms; and communications and interconnectivity protocols such as Open
Connectivity Foundation (OCF) via built-in IoTivity support. Finally, Ostro OS
is both expandable and customizable. The base OS image can be used as-is or
configured without recompiling for faster development.
