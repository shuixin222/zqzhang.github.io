title: Leaving Intel
---

After 5.5 years in the Intel Open Source Technology Center, I have decided to
move to another company. My last day at Intel is Wednesday, June 29.

I'll still be a committer and reviewer for the W3C web-platform-tests and
csswg-test. I'll stay on as test facilitator for Indexed Database API and
most specifications published by the Device and Sensors Working Group. I hope
to contribute technical efforts to Web Media specifications and code stack,
and to keep update on Web Payment, Performance and Security. Please drop me
(@zqzhang) a note if you want me to take a look at your pull request or issue.

Many people have helped me with my job at Intel. I would like to thank my
manager, Ling Yu, for her supporting of making test contributions to W3C and
Khronos, and for leading the team to make test suites and tools for the
Tizen OS and Crosswalk Project. I was impressed by her management skills
and comprehensive formal QA status reports.

Thanks to the great Web QA team, we open sourced Web [Tizen Compliance
Tests](https://source.tizen.org/compliance) 2.2.1 in tizen.org which was a
basis of following versions of TCT; and [Crosswalk Test
Suite](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-test-suite/) which has
been used by Crosswalk Project, crosswalk web testing service and demo express.

Special thanks to Tina Zhao for making travel reports, monthly status and
testing reports. I really enjoyed the business travelling with her. Yes I owe
her a cup of coffee for silently referencing her style and words of monthly
status report and testing reports. Maybe I can make an Intel recognition.

Special thanks to Fan Zhao for recruiting me as
[MeeGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeeGo) multimedia domain QA which balanced
my work and life, and for revising my annual performance review document which
was used as a basis for the following years. I was impressed by her well
preparation for the meeting with Andy Wilson for media license consulting.

Special thanks to Yugang Fan, Zhigang Li, Shuang Wan and Belem Zhang for
enjoying lunch hour together for years. Without these guys, Intel may be not a
great place to work for me!

I learned a lot from coworkers, especially from Anssi Kostiainen for his
expertise in web standards; from Wayne Carr for working as Intel's W3C Advisory
Committee representative; from Ningxin Hu for his quickly proof of concept for
enabling RealSense related technologies on Crosswalk Project and Internet of
Things.
