title: Proxy Settings
---

There is a well-known Great Wall in China. There is also a network great wall
in PRC. Therefore we have to set proxy to access to some technical documents,
source code for example from Google. Here record the proxy settings I once used.

## Windows

```batch
netsh winhttp import proxy source =ie
```

This command `import proxy source =ie` in the `netsh winhttp` context imports
the proxy settings in the Internet Explorer Web browser's Internet Options.
Importing settings from IE is the only available option.
See [Netsh Commands for Windows Hypertext Transfer
Protocol](https://technet.microsoft.com/pt-br/library/cc731131(v=ws.10).aspx).

You can also use `netsh winhttp show proxy` and `netsh winhttp reset proxy`.
See [How can I configure proxy settings for all apps, system, IE
etc?](http://superuser.com/questions/489527/how-can-i-configure-proxy-settings-for-all-apps-system-ie-etc)



## Ubuntu
