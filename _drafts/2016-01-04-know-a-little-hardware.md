title: Know A Little Hardware
---

## Why?

I have been a software engineer since I graduated on July 1st, 2008 and worked
on several projects from SirfPrimaII, to MeeGo, Tizen, to Crosswalk Project,
W3C web platform tests and CSS test. But I haven't digged into a piece of
hardware device.

Recently I was asked to set up a demo with Intel Edison and MinnowBoard Max. I
found I could not assemble the devices with lots of sensors and actuators.

## How?

Out of question, start from the hardware devices I have purchased:

* [Intel Edison and Arduino Breakout
  Kit](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html)
* [Base Shield V2](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Base_shield_v2)
* Sensors: Motion, Gas, Mini Fan, LED and LCD display
* [MinnowBoard MAX](http://wiki.minnowboard.org/MinnowBoard_Wiki_Home)
* [L12-P Micro Linear Actuator with
  Feedback](http://www.firgelli.com/pdf/L12_datasheet.pdf)
* [Linear Actuator Control
  Board](http://www.firgelli.com/Uploads/LAC_Datasheet.pdf)
* Grove starter kit plus â€“ Intel IoT Edition
* Grove Indoor Environment Kit for Intel Edison
