## Introducing Intel Edison

> an ultra small Intel® Atom™ SoC dual-core 32-bit CPU-based compute module
  aimed at small IoT and wearable computing products.

There are a document for [getting
started](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/library/edison-getting-started)
and some
[instructions](https://software.intel.com/en-us/assembling-intel-edison-board-with-arduino-expansion-board)
to help you assemble the Intel Edison board with the Arduino expansion board.
  
There are also a [product brief for boards and
kits](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/boards-and-kits/000005664.html)
which describes the features and benefits and high-level specifications, and a
[Edison board
